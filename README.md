This is a basic code that imports a .csv file containing hypocotyl length data for a variety of treatments. It aims to provide an overview of the data - it lists the average values and standard deviations for each treatment group, plots a histogram for a preliminary look at whether the data is normally distributed for each group and then plots a boxplot of the data. The boxplot is then saved to the computer.
